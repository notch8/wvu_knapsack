# Nuclear Option for the Stack Car dev stack.
# Tears down containers, removes named volumes, and removes locally built images
# for this project only — does NOT touch other Docker projects on this machine.
#
# Stack Car uses named Docker volumes (not ./data bind mounts), so no rm -rf needed.
#
# Usage:  sh scripts/cleanup-dev.sh
#
# After running, restart with:
#   sh up.local.sh
